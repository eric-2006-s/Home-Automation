# Home-Automation
This Arduino-based project uses sensors (rain, LDR, PIR, ultrasonic) to automate home tasks. It auto-closes a window when it rains, turns on lights with motion, adjusts lighting by brightness, and lets users control devices manually or via Bluetooth from a phone, making homes smarter and safer.
